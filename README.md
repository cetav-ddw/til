## To post something

**These steps are a must**

1. Clone the repo
2. Switch the branch to develop in your local env
3. Go to /src/posts directory and add a file with the .md extension
4. Inside the file write down data with this body type
```
---
path: "/Your different, special and unique post title"
date: "2019-10-02"
title: "Your post title"
author: "LuisArmando-TestCoder"
---
```
6. You could insert data as markdown, if you don't know md just follow this guide https://www.markdownguide.org
7. Now you should add, commit and push to the target remote branch
8. In Github make a pull request to master and wait for the repo administrator to give you feedback or to merge changes
